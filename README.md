# Student-Management-System
One of the SOLID priciples used was single responsibility principle. Each class has one responsibility the Student class defines base structure the UndergraduateStudent handles undergraduate logic.
The GraduateStudent handles graduate logic .Each class changes for one reason only.

The other principle used was Open/Closed Principle. The system is open for extension, you can add a new student type (PartTimeStudent) and there would be no need to modify existing classes you'd just extend Student.
